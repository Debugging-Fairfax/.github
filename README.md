# 🧩 How Debugging Fairfax Works

*(A short guide for readers and contributors)*

### The Idea

Local government should be as transparent as open-source software.

Every line of code in a good project is visible, testable, and improvable.
Why not treat our civic data the same way?

**Debugging Fairfax** is an experiment in *open-source local government.*
We gather, verify, and explain Fairfax County’s data — budgets, meetings, and public records — so anyone can understand how their government works and how to improve it.

### The Method

We follow a simple, three-step loop for every topic we cover:

| Step                | What It Means                                     | Example                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Data**         | Publish the raw source with links.                | County budget PDFs, population tables, spreadsheets. |
| **2. Diagnosis**    | Look for inconsistencies or missing pieces.       | “Two totals don’t match — what did we miss?”         |
| **3. Pull Request** | Invite readers to suggest corrections or context. | “Send a better source and we’ll update with credit.” |

Every correction is documented.
Every improvement is visible.
This is how we build trust: **through version control for facts.**

### Our Ground Rules

1. **We debug data, not people.**
   No partisan attacks or personal criticism.
2. **Sources over slogans.**
   Every number is traceable to a public document.
3. **Transparency over certainty.**
   When data conflicts, we show both and explain why.
4. **Credit where due.**
   Contributors are acknowledged in each update.

### What We Publish

Short, visual briefs called *Fairfax by the Numbers* — clear snapshots of where tax dollars go and how open government actually is.

Each brief includes:

* Key metrics (like budget per resident or meeting transparency).
* Comparisons with neighboring counties.
* Links to all source documents.

---

### How to Participate

* **Subscribe** to receive each release.
* **Fact-check** our numbers — if you find a bug, email the correction with your source.
* **Host** a small debugging session in your community.

You don’t need to be a policy expert — just curious and willing to look at data in good faith.

### Why It Matters

We’re not trying to win arguments.
We’re trying to **rebuild civic trust** by showing that facts, when verified together, can still unite people.

> *Given enough citizens, all bugs are shallow.*
